###Background

- Battleship is a one on one tactical game

- Each player attempts to guess the location of the opponents ships and sink them 

- Ships are placed on a 10x10 grid and the squares are identified by a letter and number combination

- None of the players have any idea of the opponents ship location.
- Specific number of hit pounts is located to each player and when the number reaches zero the the ship is sunk.
- When the number of ship in the possesion of player have been sunk by the opposing player the game is over.
- In Each round a  seclection is made on the opposing players board, and the square selection is used for attacking.
- An announcment is made to indicate if the attck was a hit or miss.
- if the attack is a success the ship in question loses a �hit point�
- In the event of an unsucessful attack the player is prevented from repeating the same moves by the placement of a marker on the players grid.
